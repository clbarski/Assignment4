This assignment gave me a lot of trouble. Trying to figure out how to merge a two-dimensional array took a lot of thought, and eventually I couldnt find
a great way to do it. What caught me was trying to figure out how to merge multiple arrays at once, comparing all values in each sub array at the same time. What I ended up doing was adding the elements from the 2D array to a new array and merge sorting that. The code runs and compiles as it should and works with multiple test cases.
